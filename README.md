# WebTool_FinalProject

### 4/6/17 work <br>
Started to do sth.<br>
Set up a general agenda, created package for action layer, service layer, DAO layer. <br>
SSL security, filter, interpreter, validation will be added last. <br>

### 4/7/17 work <br>
Built object model. Split the project into 3 parts (generate menu, communication and forum, shopping cart).<br>
Created UserDAO, MealDAO, MealItemDAO, FoodDAO

### 4/8/17 work <br>
Added hibernate mapping to Account, User, Employee, Food, MealItem, Meal<br>

### 4/9/17 work <br>
Started to work on JSP pages with Dreamweaver. Tried bootstrap, these pages look really nice...but I'll probably discard all designs later due to limited time<br>
Still, JS and AJAX is required for front-end pagination and sorting.
